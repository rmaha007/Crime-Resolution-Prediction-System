# Crime-Resolution-Prediction-System
This project applies machine learning to predict whether a crime case will be resolved (solved) or remain unresolved, using historical crime records from the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD).
The system integrates supervised classification models with exploratory clustering techniques to provide predictive insights and identify hidden crime patterns.
